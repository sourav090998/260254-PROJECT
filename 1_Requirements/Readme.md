# Requirements
## Introduction
 * There are a wide range of sorts of Resistor accessible which can be utilized in both electrical and electronic circuits to control the progression of flow or to deliver a voltage drop from multiple points of view. But in order to perform the work, resistor needs to have some type of "resistive" or "obstruction" values. Resistors are available in wide range of values which are used as per requirements.
 * The resistance value, tolerance, and wattage rating are printed in a number or letters on the large size of resistor having high values but in small size of resistor the resistance value, tolerance, and wattage rating are printed in a form of colour band which is called Resistance colour band.
 This project is based on C programming concepts which is perfectly assembled to find the exact value of resistor in Ohms by using resistor colour code.


## Research
* Resistance colour code calculator is a software program used to find the resistance value of the resistor 
## Cost and Features
* 
## Defining Our System

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H
## Who:

* Person working with electronics circuit.

## What:

* This code will be used to detect the value of the resistor and also calculate the combination value of the resistors

## When:

* 1.Anytime a resistor value is depicted from the color Code.
* 2.Anytime a combination of resistor needs to be solved. 

## Where:

* In any application of Electgronics where the resistor is used and values are calculated.
## How:

* This helps the user to get the value of the resistor at the fingertips by using simple menu driven programs.
