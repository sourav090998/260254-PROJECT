# Requirements
## Introduction
 * There are a wide range of sorts of Resistor accessible which can be utilized in both electrical and electronic circuits to control the progression of flow or to deliver a voltage drop from multiple points of view. But in order to perform the work, resistor needs to have some type of "resistive" or "obstruction" values. Resistors are available in wide range of values which are used as per requirements.
 * The resistance value, tolerance, and wattage rating are printed in a number or letters on the large size of resistor having high values but in small size of resistor the resistance value, tolerance, and wattage rating are printed in a form of colour band which is called Resistance colour band.
 This project is based on C programming concepts which is perfectly assembled to find the exact value of resistor in Ohms by using resistor colour code.


## Research
* Resistance colour code calculator is a software program used to find the resistance value of the resistor 
## Cost and Features

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H
## Who:

* Person involved in circuit related projects and daily basis circuit problems.

## What:

* While making the large electronic circuits, it is nessesary to use required value of resistor but it becomes a tedious and time consuming task to find the resistance of any random resistor.

## When:

* Always while using the resistor in the electronic circuits.

## Where:

* This problem is always expected in resistor based electronic circuits.

## How:

* This issue may cause the error in the electronic circuits and hence there can be huge wastage of time and it may also cause problem in other components attached in the circuit.
