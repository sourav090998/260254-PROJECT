# RESISTOR COLOR CALCULATOR

A resistor is one of the most common building blocks used in electronics circuits. Resistors are available in several shapes and sizes. Our online tool decodes the  information for color banded axial lead resistors. Just select the color bands from your resistor and the site will determine the resistor value for you.

For very small electronic components, a color code is used instead of printed text. This color code indicates the value, rating and tolerance. Resistors have standard colors for identification of the resistance. The printed colors gives an accurate representation on the value of the resistor.

Resistors can have 3, 4, 5 or 6 color bands printed on them. The first 3 or 4 bands give the basic value in ohms, of the resistor. A 5 band resistor is more precise compared to a 4 band because of the inclusion of a third significant digit. A 6-band resistor is like a 5-band but includes a temperature coefficient band.

# RESISTOR IN SERIES

Resistors are said to be in series whenever the current flows through the resistors sequentially. Since there is only one path for the charges to flow through, the current is the same through each resistor. The equivalent resistance of a set of resistors in a series connection is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual resistances.
